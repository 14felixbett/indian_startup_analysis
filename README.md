# Indian Start-up Ecosystem Analysis

This repository contains the analysis of the Indian start-up ecosystem from 2018 to 2021. The goal of this project is to understand the landscape of the Indian start-up ecosystem and identify potential areas of opportunity for our team's development.

## Data

The data used in this analysis is sourced from publicly available datasets on Indian start-ups. The data includes information on funding, sectors, and other relevant metrics.

## Methodology

To accomplish the task of suggesting a suitable plan of action for our team's development, we have created a distinctive narrative based on the 2018 to 2021 Indian start-up datasets. This involved formulating and evaluating a hypothesis, preparing research questions, conducting analysis, and presenting insights through appropriate visualizations.

## Results

Our analysis has uncovered some interesting insights on the Indian start-up ecosystem. One key takeaway is the growing importance of the fintech sector in the Indian start-up ecosystem. According to our analysis, fintech companies have received the most significant funding in recent years, making it a highly lucrative area for potential investors.
